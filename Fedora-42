# Fedora 42 Post Install Guide
Things to do after installing Fedora 42

## RPM Fusion & Terra

* Fedora has disabled the repositories for a lot of free and non-free .rpm packages by default. Follow this if you want to use non-free software like Steam, Discord and some multimedia codecs etc. As a general rule of thumb it is advised to do this to get access to many mainstream useful programs.
* Enable third party repositories by pasting the following into the terminal: 
* `sudo dnf install https://mirrors.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm https://mirrors.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm`
* For Terra:
* `sudo dnf install --nogpgcheck --repofrompath 'terra,https://repos.fyralabs.com/terra$releasever' terra-release`
* also while you're at it, install app-stream metadata by:
* `sudo dnf group upgrade core`
* `sudo dnf4 group install core`
  

## Update 
* Go into the software center and click on update. Alternatively, you can do:
* `sudo dnf -y update`
* Reboot

## Firmware
* If your system supports firmware update delivery through lvfs, update your device firmware by:
```
sudo fwupdmgr refresh --force
sudo fwupdmgr get-devices # Lists devices with available updates.
sudo fwupdmgr get-updates # Fetches list of available updates.
sudo fwupdmgr update
```

## Flatpak
* Fedora doesn't include all non-free flatpaks by default. The command below enables access to all the flathub flatpaks. Particularly useful for users of Fedora KDE and other spins since they do not get the "Enable Third Party Repositories" option on initial boot.
* `flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://dl.flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo`

## AppImage

* For Appimage support install fuse:
* `sudo dnf in fuse`
* You can also install an AppImage manager like [Gearlever](https://flathub.org/apps/it.mijorus.gearlever) for neater management. To do so, run the following command:
* `flatpak install it.mijorus.gearlever` 

## Media Codecs
* Install these to get proper multimedia playback.
````
sudo dnf4 group install multimedia
sudo dnf swap 'ffmpeg-free' 'ffmpeg' --allowerasing # Switch to full FFMPEG.
sudo dnf upgrade @multimedia --setopt="install_weak_deps=False" --exclude=PackageKit-gstreamer-plugin # Installs gstreamer components. Required if you use Gnome Videos and other dependent applications.
sudo dnf group install -y sound-and-video # Installs useful Sound and Video complementary packages.
````

## Set Hostname
* `hostnamectl set-hostname YOUR_HOSTNAME`

## Set UTC Time
* Used to counter time inconsistencies in dual boot systems
* `sudo timedatectl set-local-rtc '0'`

### Disable `NetworkManager-wait-online.service`
* Disabling it can decrease the boot time by at least ~15s-20s:
* `sudo systemctl disable NetworkManager-wait-online.service`

### Disable Gnome Software from Startup Apps
* Gnome software autostarts on boot for some reason, even though it is not required on every boot unless you want it to do updates in the background, this takes at least 100MB of RAM upto 900MB (as reported anecdotically). You can stop it from autostarting by:
* `sudo rm /etc/xdg/autostart/org.gnome.Software.desktop`

## Gnome Extensions [Optional]
* Suggestions for good utilities to extend the capabilities of your system
* Don't install these if you are using a different spin of Fedora.
* Pop Shell - run `sudo dnf install -y gnome-shell-extension-pop-shell xprop` to install it.
* [GSconnect](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1319/gsconnect/) - run `sudo dnf install nautilus-python` for full support. then `sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-service=kdeconnect`
